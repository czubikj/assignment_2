# assignment_2
New git repository for assignment_2.

This is assignment 2, my first repository.

The code, created for a previous assignment, is meant to replicate an atm.

A preset pin code (1234) is requested from the user.

If the correct code is correctly inputed, the account balance is printed.
The individual is given three opportunities to input the valid pin code.
Else, an incorrect code is inputed three times, the user is informed that the
account has been locked and the police are on their way.
