# assignment_2
New git repository for assignment_2.

This is assignment 2, my first repository.

The code, created for a previous assignment is meant to serve as an atm.

A preset pin code (1234) is requested from the user.

The user has three opportunities to input the correct code.
If the correct code is inputed, the account balance is printed.
The individual is given three opportunities to input the valid pin code.
Else, an incorrect code is inputed three times, the user is informed that the
account has been locked and the police are on their way.
